# Cool, I've been selected for the Featured Student Work of the Month: August on the kandeze blog.

See the [Blog entry](https://blog.kadenze.com/2016/09/02/featured-student-work-month-august/ "link to the kadenze blog")  
Also published on my [exhibition page]({{site.baseurl}}/exhibitions/processing/genetic-algorithm-01.html "intern link to the exhibition")

Kadenze is a platform for Online Arts and Technology courses.

>Kadenze brings together educators, artists, and engineers from leading universities across the globe to provide a world-class education in the fields of art and creative technology.

Actually I was a bit surprised that I was selected because, being a bit late for the submission, I had no time to render it more nicely.

I think the the staff appreciated that I've chosen an example for a genetic algorithm implementation that is different from
the course content.
