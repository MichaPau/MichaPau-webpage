# So after years (more than ten actually) as a freelance worker, I finally come up with my own web page.  
It take me so long because before I always had fixed clients and there was no need for self promotion or to be _googleable_ by any means.  
Now, I am looking for more individual projects and to include more creativity in my work.

I am from Vienna, Austria but I live since some years in Rennes, in the beautiful region of Brittany/France.

So why is this page in English when I am in a francophone country?

It's because I want to keep it international and even French people with their _a bit funny_ but _beautiful_ accent do speak English!

A translation will come one day anyway.
