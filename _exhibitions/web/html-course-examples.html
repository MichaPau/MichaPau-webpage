		<h2>Canvas Selfi Application</h2>
		<div class="excerpt-container">
			<div><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/thumbnails/selfi_app_thumb_01.png" alt="Selfi application thumbnail"></div>
			<p>
				This is a selfi application. It uses the camera, the canvas, WebGL for rendering and pixi.js for the filters.
				It has 2 modes - normal and rendered in a polaroid frame.  <br>
				In the moment <span class="important">this works only in Firefox</span> because:<br>
				1. Chrome and Opera doesn't allow getUserMedia anymore without a SSL connection. (I won't purchase a certificate only for this example).<br>
				2. Internet Explorer doesn't support getUserMedia at all.<br>
				<br>
				(1) will just fail silently for the user (error shows only in the console).

		<h2>Canvas Ball Game</h2>
		<div class="excerpt-container">
			<div><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/thumbnails/game_thumb_01.png" alt="Canvas game thumbnail"></div>
			<p>
				Simple ball game rendered on the canvas. This was a playground for canvas animation, collision detection etc.
				Surly it's not an addictive great game but the goal was to play around with that stuff and make something actually playable.
				That was as well a possibility to use sound samples and try out the HTML5 Audio API.

				As an example for indexedDB I choose to make a Kanban board. As a prototype it is very simple.
